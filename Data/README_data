"A Bayesian Approach to Grounded Color Semantics"
ANONYMOUS 

This is the DATA readme. 

The data is in the data folder.  
The corpusindex.txt file is in this top level folder. 
Each line of the corpusindex.txt is:  name,filename

Each label's data is split into 4 parts.  
First, there was a 70/30 train and test split. 
The test data is in {label}.test. All 3 dimensions (HSV) are in this file.
The 3 dimensions were split for each label. They are in {label}.{dim}_train
where {dim} \in (h,s,v).  The train files have implicit indexing: 
the first line of each file corresponds to the first datum, the second line to the second datum, etc
A file (corpus_creation.py) is included detailing how the corpus was created from Munroe's dataset. 

Finally, there are merge sets and bad word sets. 
These were results of hand pruning, and thus included in the release. 
These are also put into use in the corpus_creation.py script.
