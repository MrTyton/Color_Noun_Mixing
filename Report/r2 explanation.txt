How and Why am using R^2:

R^2 is used to determine how well a model fits the observed data. The equation for R^2 is R^2 = 1 - SS_res / SS_tot, with SS_res defined as the sum of square residuals, and SS_tot defined as the total sum of squares. Normally, this is used to see how well the created model fits the data, however in this case we cannot compare the actual data points and our generated model. The models that we are using do not give us predictions of points, rather they give us likelihoods that the point could have been *generated* by that model. Therefore, our original, observed points are in fact the outputs of the original model that we are trying to recreate. Our predicted points is the output of our generated, created model.

We want our created model to behave very similarly to the original model. If it does behave the same, then the R^2 value will be very close to 1, the SS_res will be close to 0. If the model is very different, then it is possible to get a negative R^2 value, as SS_res, which is calculated with the original model's output and the generated model's output, can be larger than SS_tot, which is only calculated with the original model's output. As the new models have not been generated with the output of the original models, and only with their parameters, it is possible that the generated model's outputs are very far off the mark.
